After four years of radio silence (yikes!) I've begun blogging again. Most of what I write about is the practical side of my work as a web designer/developer. But I also want a place to explore and write–at least occasionally–about my other interests. So, I've decided to reorganize a bit.

I've moved all my technical blog posts about design and development over to [HYBRD](https://hybrd.co/), my studio website. I'll be reserving this site for personal posts, as well as less technical posts about design, development, the web, media, etc.
